Integration in Paligemma
In the Paligemma system, SigLIP and Gemma work in tandem to process and understand multimodal inputs. SigLIP handles visual data, converting it into a format that can be integrated with the textual data processed by Gemma. The fusion layer then combines these representations, allowing the core understanding engine to interpret the integrated data and generate appropriate responses. This integration enables Paligemma to excel in tasks that require a deep understanding of both visual and textual information.
